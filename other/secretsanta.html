						<h1>Secret Santa</h1>
						<p>
							Every year, for the Dutch holiday 'Sinterklaas', I create a special project to add some extra fun and creativity to our family's 'Secret Santa' tradition.<br><br>
						</p>
						<p class=gray>
							Each project brings a new twist to our gift-giving, whether through customized gift exchanges, playful challenges, or themed surprises.<br><br>
							These projects make our 'Sinterklaas' celebration more memorable and engaging for everyone involved.

						<h2>2023</h2>
						<p class=gray>Receiver: Everyone</p>
						<p>In 2023, I created a TV application for a quiz game where everyone could connect and play. Participants entered their answers on their own phones, with each correct answer earning one point and the fastest answer earning an additional point. After all the questions, the person with the most points received their present location first. A simulated 'Sinterklaas' would call (causing the <a class=white href=https://www.philips-hue.com/ target=_blank title="Philips Hue">Philips Hue <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> lights to flicker) to reveal where to find the present in the house.</p>

						<h2>2022</h2>
						<p class=gray>Receiver: Mother</p>
						<p>
							In 2022, I created a small app disguised as a cycling app (since my mom likes cycling) and secretly installed it on her phone. The app began with a simulated call from 'Sinterklaas,' followed by a scavenger hunt where she had to find hidden codes around the house using hints displayed on the app. The <a class=white href=https://www.philips-hue.com/ target=_blank title="Philips Hue">Philips Hue <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a> lights would turn <span style=color:#32cd32>green</span> for a correct code and <span style=color:red>red</span> for a wrong one. After the final code, the location of the present was revealed by another simulated call from 'Sinterklaas'.

						<h2>2021</h2>
						<p class=gray>Receiver: Father</p>
						<p>
							In 2021, I built a <span style=color:#4169e1>blue</span> box to hold the present, which was locked and connected to an Arduino. The box was linked to an app I secretly installed on his phone. To unlock the box, he had to complete a series of challenges on the app. Once all the challenges were completed, the box unlocked.

						<h2>2020</h2>
						<p class=gray>Receiver: Brother</p>
						<p>
							In 2020, I built my first app, creating a scavenger hunt throughout the entire house. Each room had a hidden card with a riddle, and the answer to each riddle was a code that needed to be entered into the app to reveal the next location. The final location led to his present.
